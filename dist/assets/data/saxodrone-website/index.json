The idea was to combine what I've seen with synths, guitars, and vocals do with live looping, and see what the saxophone could contribute to that space.</p>\n<p>In 2021, I wanted to created a simple website that displayed all the information I wanted, yet displayed graphics and sound in an interesting way.  I came across <a href=\"ojack.xyz\" title=\"Olivia Jack\">Olivia Jack's</a> example of incorporating Hydra Video Synth with a microframework called [Choo.io](<a href=\"https://choo.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://choo.io</a>), and I had to take a stab at it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/choo.png\"></p>\n<p>The whole framework is based in es6 javascript, which means that most of the application made use of es6 templating to build websites.</p>\n<p>What choo does provide is view, routing, mounting, and other standard features of front-end frameworks.  I found it a great use case as a developer who hasn't fully committed to particular framework yet.</p>\n<p>I then did my own photography and used photoshop to capture my saxophone for the webpage.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/dsc00102.JPG\"></p>\n<p>Then I used atom to live code in hydra the background for the website.  There's been a few iterations, but ultimately I landed with a design that matched the color scheme and didn't distract too much from everything else.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/2021-10-24-17-48-41.png\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/2021-10-24-17-51-24.png\"></p>\n<p>One of the trickier parts was getting the audio to play when I wanted to.  It's not quite like css where you can see the error. When the audio doesn't play when you want it to, there's a lot pulling teeth and scratching head.</p>\n<p>I took a small sample from my intro track and used that as the transition between the link-tree look and the traditional home page look.</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
