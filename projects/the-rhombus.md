The Rhombus is a collective focused on creating monetized live-streaming events and interactive experiences through a virtual 3D venue.  The venue is hosted on Decentraland, a web3-enabled platform with its own ecosystem of virtual land, avatars, and live events.

## Mission

Making our own venue, and defining our own rules is a more difficult task than joining a platform or signing onto a label.  But for us, creating a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), seems to be a way that we can work on our own terms, and belong to an evolving community of creators.  Following the tradition of non-profit co-ops, RhombusDAO aims to be an organization for live-streaming artists to make a sustainable career from their art. We focus on informed consent, consensus, accessibility, and democratic principles to redefine what it means to create a music-focused organization.
