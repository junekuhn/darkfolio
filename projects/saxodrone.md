In 2020, I created a solo project called [Saxodrone](https://saxodr.one "Saxodrone").  The idea was to combine what I've seen with synths, guitars, and vocals do with live looping, and see what the saxophone could contribute to that space.  

In 2021, I wanted to created a simple website that displayed all the information I wanted, yet displayed graphics and sound in an interesting way.  I came across [Olivia Jack's](ojack.xyz "Olivia Jack") example of incorporating Hydra Video Synth with a microframework called \[Choo.io\](https://choo.io), and I had to take a stab at it.

The whole framework is based in es6 javascript, which means that most of the application made use of es6 templating to build websites.  

What choo does provide is view, routing, mounting, and other standard features of front-end frameworks.  I found it a great use case as a developer who hasn't fully committed to particular framework yet.

I then did my own photography and used photoshop to capture my saxophone for the webpage.

Then I used atom to live code in hydra the background for the website.  There's been a few iterations, but ultimately I landed with a design that matched the color scheme and didn't distract too much from everything else.  

One of the trickier parts was getting the audio to play when I wanted to.  It's not quite like css where you can see the error. When the audio doesn't play when you want it to, there's a lot pulling teeth and scratching head.

I took a small sample from my intro track and used that as the transition between the link-tree look and the traditional home page look.
