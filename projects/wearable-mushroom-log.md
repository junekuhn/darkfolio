The mushroom log materializes the way that artifacts in video games are created,
through 3D models and UV maps. This project combines the processes of 3D printing
and CNC embroidery to create a colorful, textured artifact that resembles a 3D model.
The novelty of this project is the process of using texture baking to map a generated
vertex color to a UV map, which can then be printed on a CNC embroidery machine.
Itâ€™s also a wearable, and can slide onto my arm.
