**Role**

As Pearlfisher's creative technologist, my role was building a site based on the designs provided by our freelance UX/UI designer.  

The first task was organizing the designs in Figma into data structures that could be easily viewed and edited by the client with Sanity CMS.  This headless CMS enables a custom UI layout akin to Ghost for anyone without coding abilities to easily arrange, modify, and add new content to the website.  

Shopify Hydrogen, which is much like Next.js, is a Javascript meta-framework that allows for easy integration of React Typescript, Shopify data, and Sanity data all in one website. Built-in are several convenience hooks for routing, querying data via GraphQL and groq, 

Hydrogen also operates with the Next.js style of server-side rendering, which affords better speeds for larger amounts of content.  

On the creative side, I added several kinds of interactions for users to have a richer experience with the content.  I used SVG and CSS filters, as they're native to the browser and don't require any external libraries.  Server-side rendering proved difficult with GreenSock, which is a client-side only library.  I implemented the interactive logo design laid out by my colleague using SVG and designed my own interactions that played with lighting and shadow.
