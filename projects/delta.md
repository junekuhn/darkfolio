As an immersive media support specialist at DELTA, I contributed to 4 courses, across 3 grant cycles. I also participated in research and development for immersive media and new immersive media platform for use in the classroom.

## PRT 458

I did video editing, audio editing, and interaction design for a course on event-risk management.  My team recorded 360 video for a 5K run at different points in time and location to capture the event, warts and all.  We then ran the video by the instructor, who pointed out both correct and incorrect event safety protocols.

After the content was compiled, a my colleague Rhett and I authored a VR experience for students to traverse the event and hear the voiceover of the instructor to learn about event safety.

## Chemistry

I designed and created a web-based molecule visualization/sonification based in three.js for a chemistry course. My supervisor for the project made a chart for students to see different configurations of each molecule in 2D, and I took the 3D models authored in Blender and created an interface for students to interact with the molecules.

## FOR 595 Fire Ecology

I designed and created a website that functioned as an aggregator for different types of immersive media for a fire ecology course.
