Directed and Edited by Justin Kuhn, this short film details the immense anxiety, dread, and loneliness of the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic. Using one clip, a Moog Mother-32, and lots of video feedback, this film describes the process in which everyone has questioned what they're doing, while they're doing it, to the point where sense of direction and purpose is lost entirely.
