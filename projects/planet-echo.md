I built a chain of effects in Supercollider during my residency for Kepler Concordia Launchpad, and the performance took place at Harmony House in Lake Oswego, Oregon.  Played on a 4.1 Quadraphonic array, you can hear the planets travel around the listener and the echos are timed relative to their distance from the sun.  Planet-to-planet proximity is sonified through real-time filtering effects.  Recorded on a Zoom H2N, the spatial positions have been maintained from the performance using ambisonics.
