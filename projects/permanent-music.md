_Permanent Music_ is a smart contract, with the ability to mint ERC721 (non-fungible) tokens. These tokens have stored musical information that can be played back through a website or software application. The contract itself is deployed on a low-carbon, layer-2 side chain called Polygon, which reduces the ecological impact of Ethereum significantly (Digiconomist, 2022). It cost £2.16 to deploy, and I set the cost of minting to less than £0.01. 

This contract is easiest to access through the artifact’s Github repository, which uses web 3.0 infrastructure to interact with blockchains. Coupled with the integration of Web MIDI API, now a native technology in all modern web browsers, anyone can play back the MIDI data from a token to the MIDI device of their choosing. In this context, a financial paradigm of trading and speculating becomes a musical playground, wherein musicians, developers, and other enthusiasts can make use of royalty-free data to create new works. 

By creating a smart contract and deploying it with MIDI-engraving capabilities, music information is positioned as a permanent and public resource, with the potential to be reinterpreted or reimagined into new forms of art. It puts MIDI data as the central point of configuration. It allows sharing sharing and collaboration, much like the ways of early internet peer-to-peer torrents (Field, 2001). And as MIDI is just a specification on how to interpret raw data, the permanent data also can be extended to other artistic forms. MIDI can be mapped to many kinds of artistic mediums, from visual art to human movement (Breve et al, 2022). While most music-related non-fungible tokens are individual song recordings, an abstract set of data allows the artist to apply any rhythm, any bassline, or any accompaniment to that source. _Permanent Music_ points to the ubiquity of data and how common standards can be used for different applications. 

This model of infrastructure takes influence from The Sphere, a “research-creation project” that reimagines arts funding and business practices (Bordeleau, 2021). “\[The Sphere\] allows for artists, cultural workers, audiences and organizations of different kinds—that is, a wide range of sympathizers and other potential stakeholders—to initiate creative collaborations and implement new funding strategies” (2021). _Permanent Music_ provides greater specificity to these concepts by providing a tangible seed from which artistic exploration can follow. The use of MIDI situates the smart contract in the context of music composition, arrangement, and instrumentation. The premiere artifact implements the idea of an ‘anarchive’, which moves beyond documentation to production methods that adapt to developments in technology. With music, and potentially other disciplines of art, the priority of technology isn’t what we can extract from the world, but what we can share, create, and perform for other people. 

Because the data is organized through the MIDI protocol, the contract ascribes a particular way the data will be used. Music-centered blockchain usage aims to produce ‘cultural and economic equity with new forms of contractual and non-contractual bonds’, a goal outlined by Gerald Nestler (2018, p.142). Orienting infrastructure around arts, culture, and community relationships could shift the way that assets, artifacts, and symbols are valued. By subverting the process of commodifying music with the musicking of finances, new relationships emerge between the art created and the people who create it.
