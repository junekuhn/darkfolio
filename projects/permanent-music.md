Permanent Music is a smart contract, with the ability to mint ERC721 (non-fungible) tokens with embedded MIDI data. The MIDI data can be read through a website or software application and played back through any MIDI device. This contract is easiest to access through the artifactâ€™s Github repository, which uses web 3.0 infrastructure to interact with blockchains. Coupled with the integration of Web MIDI API, now a native technology in all modern web browsers, anyone can play back the MIDI data from a token to the MIDI device of their choosing. In this context, a financial paradigm of trading and speculating becomes a musical playground, wherein musicians, developers, and other enthusiasts can make use of royalty-free data to create new works.
